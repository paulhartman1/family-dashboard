# 🏡 Swoboda Family Dashboard

A custom-built, privacy-first family dashboard designed to help us stay connected, organized, and present — together.

- 🍽️ Meal planning + shopping lists
- 🌤️ Weather forecasts
- 🪞 Smart display support (wall tablet, mirror view)
- 📱 PWA/mobile install support
- 🔒 Private, fast, and beautiful

This project also serves as a showcase of clean, maintainable engineering for freelance/consulting work through [LoveOnDev](https://loveondev.com).
